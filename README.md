# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
This project was created in order to refer back to information that we learned during prework. Notes that were taken during this process are reflected in the webpage for us to open and read when we want to study or read back on it.
I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git in order to complete this project, and how each language works and communicates with one another to form a website.
